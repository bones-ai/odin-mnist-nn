# Mnist Network Visualization
A visualization of an MNIST neural network written from scratch in Odin and Raylib

## Usage
- Clone the repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:bones-ai/odin-mnist-nn.git
cd odin-mnist-nn
```
- Run the simulation
```bash
./build.sh speed && ./odin-mnist-nn
```
- The simulation currently uses a preloaded network, update the `main.odin` to train a new network.
- `configs.odin` is the configuration file

## Train a network yourself
- You'll need the mnist data files from - [kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv/data)
- Put the 2 files `mnist_test.csv` and `mnist_train.csv` in a new folder called `data` at the root of the project

## Extras
- I post project updates on my [Twitter - @BonesaiDev](https://x.com/BonesaiDev)
