# Mnist Network Visualization
A visualization of an MNIST neural network written from scratch in Odin and Raylib

# Demo

## Usage
- Clone the repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:bones-ai/odin-mnist-nn.git
cd odin-mnist-nn
```
- Run the simulation
```bash
./build.sh speed && ./odin-nn
```
- The simulation currently uses a preloaded network, update the `main.odin` to train a new network.
- `configs.odin` is the configuration file
